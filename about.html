Cosmoptera - also known as LCS, or Lordcakespy - has been creating and uploading electronic music online since at least 2015. Her music encompasses a multitude of different genres, drawing inspiration from the video game music of her youth, as well as techno, synthwave, house, chiptune, and classical music influences.<br>
<br>
Cosmoptera’s early work consists mainly of soundtracks for Terraria mods, including the Spirit Mod and Shadows of Abaddon. After nearly three years of creating mod music, she released her first solo album, <i>Retrolysis</i>, in December of 2017. In 2019, she left the modding community to work on her second album, <i>Space Prom</i>, which she released in April of 2019.<br>
<br>
In 2020, she began participating in the cultural event of Blaseball, and in November of the same year, released her first track with The Garages, “Heart and Swole (Theme of the Tokyo Lift)”, on their album <i>BLATTLE OF THE BLANDS</i>, as well as the solo EP <i>Sketchbook</i>. She would contribute further original songs and covers to the albums <i>neon fakes, STRIKE ONE!, World Tour: Part 2, STRIKE TWO!!, Tribute Act 2: Headliners, Fourth Strike Song Jam 2021, TA3.1: DECLASSIFIED, and fourth strike song jam 2022</i>. Further tracks from the 2021 and 2022 song jams would be released on <i>Vignettes from the New American Frontier</i> and <i>Slample Platter</i>.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cosmoptera released her third album, <i>Themes and Variations</i>, in June 2022. Most recently, she released an album of remixes of songs from the webcomic Homestuck, <i>Vinculum Vitae</i>, in April 2023. In September of the same year, four songs from <i>Vinculum Vitae</i> and one new remix, “GALACTIC INCOHERENCE ~ Cosmic NaN Propagation”, were featured on the compilation album <i>Land of Fans and Music 5 Act 2</i>.<br>
